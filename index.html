                <p>Author of <em>The Healthy Programmer</em></p>

                <p>
                  To keep doing what you love, you need to maintain your own
                  systems, not just the ones you write code for. Your health
                  affects your ability to learn, remember, concentrate, and be
                  creativeâ€“skills critical to doing your job well. But working
                  out at the gym might not be enough to stay fit if you spend
                  the rest of the day sitting in front of a computer. Some
                  surprising new science has revealed that the lifestyle most
                  commonly associated with programming can actually counteract
                  the benefits of exercise. In this talk you'll learn how to
                  change your work habits, boost your brainpower, master
                  exercises that make working at a computer more comfortable,
                  and develop a plan to keep fit, healthy, and sharp for years
                  to come.

                  Naming things is hard, not just in computer science. Douglas
                  Gayeton and his project _Lexicon of sustainability_ aims to
                  create a shared vocabulary that helps us talk about food.
                  Consumers make smarter choices about the food they eat and
                  feed their families when they know where it comes from, how
                  it's farmed. It all starts with words...
