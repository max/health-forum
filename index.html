          Health Forum is one day tech conference about debugging mind and
          body. We want to inspire people in and around tech to (re)discover
          healthier living, discuss topics like burnout, explore the concept of
          mindfulness, and learn about a transparent food system.

                <p>Author of <em>The Healthy Programmer</em></p>

                <p>
                  To keep doing what you love, you need to maintain your own
                  systems, not just the ones you write code for. Your health
                  affects your ability to learn, remember, concentrate, and be
                  creative–skills critical to doing your job well. But working
                  out at the gym might not be enough to stay fit if you spend
                  the rest of the day sitting in front of a computer. Some
                  surprising new science has revealed that the lifestyle most
                  commonly associated with programming can actually counteract
                  the benefits of exercise. In this talk you'll learn how to
                  change your work habits, boost your brainpower, master
                  exercises that make working at a computer more comfortable,
                  and develop a plan to keep fit, healthy, and sharp for years
                  to come.

                <h3>Kenneth Reitz: Awareness of Self: Mind Over Matter</h3>

                <p>
                  Kenneth Reitz is the product owner of Python at Heroku and a
                  fellow at the Python Software Foundation. Kenneth focuses on
                  software development, photography, and music production. He
                  is well known for his many open source software projects,
                  specifically Requests: HTTP for Humans.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Powerful personal experiences are often dismissed by others
                  due to a lack of supporting scientific evidence. Contoversy
                  surrounds the supposed dietary effects of gluten, for
                  example, despite the fact that millions of people claim that
                  removing gluten from their diets has made a profound impact
                  upon their lives. Why is this?
                </p>

                <p>
                  The fact of the matter is that it simply doesn’t matter
                  whether or not gluten has the mechanical effect that is
                  claimed — all that matters is your own direct experience. The
                  placebo effect is very real and proves just how powerful our
                  own perceptions effect our body, mind, and overall wellness.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Kenneth will be sharing his story of self-transformation of
                  body and mind over the past two years. Following your heart.

                </p>

                <p>
                  Katelin’s first computer was an Apple IIe. She was 3 years
                  old. She’s spent the last 30 years on quest to unplug.
                  Partner at whil Concepts, a health and wellness platform
                  geared to bring mindfulness to the modern person, Katelin is
                  passionate about enabling people to live happier, healthier,
                  and more engaged lives. Her journey includes a 5 year stint
                  at Pixar Animation Studios, building some serious #PeopleGeek
                  chops at Klout, a layover at advertising giant McCann
                  Worldgroup, and surviving a particularly wily bunch of first
                  graders as an elementary school teacher. In her quest, she’s
                  learned that it’s OK to hit the reset button and reboot.
                  Sometimes you have to power down to power up and power
                  forward.

                  In a world where the speed of digital information is
                  exponentially increasing, people need a set of tools to cope
                  with technostress overload before burning out. When you’re
                  always on, the intersection where your personal life and work
                  life meet becomes more complex. Mindfulness is about making
                  the necessary blank space to find your focus, increase your
                  performance, get creative, and enrich your relationships.
                  With technology and training deeply rooted in science, the
                  digital lifestyle that once maxed out our load capacity is
                  now providing an outlet for us to harness the power to
                  unplug.

                  the boundaries of traditional and converging media since the

                  series for PBS, and author of both <em>SLOW: Life in a Tuscan

                  Gayeton and his project <em>Lexicon of Sustainability</em>
                  aim to create a shared vocabulary that helps us talk about
                  food. We make smarter choices about the food we eat and feed
                  our families when we know where it comes from, and how it's
                  farmed. It all starts with words...
